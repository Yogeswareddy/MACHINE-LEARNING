Wheat Seeds Dataset

The Wheat Seeds Dataset involves the prediction of species given measurements of seeds from 
different varieties of wheat.

It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class 
is balanced. There are 210 observations with 7 input variables and 1 output variable. 

The variable names are as follows:

Area.
Perimeter.
Compactness
Length of kernel.
Width of kernel.
Asymmetry coefficient.
Length of kernel groove.
Class (1, 2, 3).
